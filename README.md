like word count, reading time, author and topics for articles.

users unless you explicitly decide to share it. Your whole profile can

profile" (uncheck).

You can effortlessly export all your data in JSON format. You don't have
to worry about lock-in or Tefter becoming unavailable.

## Notes

You can write notes using Markdown on your bookmarks and lists.

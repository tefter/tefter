## Privacy

We don't sell your data. Anything you post won't be public to other
users unless you explicitly decide to share it. Your whole profile can
be unlisted via Privacy Settings -> "Allow others to discover my
profile" (uncheck).

## Feed

There's variety of news sources you can subscribe to and create a personalized feed of the latest and most interesting
things to read. When you follow users and they share bookmarks, they will also appear in your feed.
